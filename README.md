An AI-powered candidate ranking system that scores and ranks resumes/candidate profiles against a job description using a **hybrid retrieval approach** — combining **BM25 lexical matching**, **Sentence-Transformer semantic embeddings**, and **rule-based scoring signals** (skills, experience, education) — with **explainable AI** output for every ranked candidate.

Built as part of the *India Runs on Data & AI* challenge.

## ✨ Features

- **Hybrid Ranking Engine** — blends lexical (BM25) and semantic (Sentence-Transformers) relevance with structured profile signals for a final weighted score.
- **Explainable Results** — every ranked candidate comes with a human-readable explanation: matched skills, experience summary, education summary, and individual sub-scores.
- **JD Parsing** — reads job descriptions directly from `.docx` or plain text files.
- **Cached Embeddings** — candidate embeddings are computed once and cached to disk (`processed/embeddings.pkl`) for fast repeated ranking runs.
- **CSV Output** — final ranked list (rank, candidate ID, name, score, explanation) is exported to `output.csv`.

## 🧠 How It Works

For a given job description, each candidate is scored using a weighted combination of:

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic similarity (embeddings) | 0.35 | Cosine similarity between JD and candidate profile embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) |
| BM25 relevance | 0.30 | Classic lexical/keyword relevance score |
| Skill match | 0.25 | Fraction of candidate's listed skills explicitly mentioned in the JD |
| Experience | 0.07 | Normalized years of experience + career-history depth bonus |
| Education | 0.03 | Degree level and institution tier |
| Career bonus | +0.05 | Bonus if candidate has held AI/ML/NLP/Search-related roles |

All sub-scores are normalized (Min-Max scaling) before being combined into a single `score` between 0 and 1.

An `ExplanationGenerator` then converts the raw scores and matched signals into a readable explanation string, e.g.:

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the complete workflow of the AI Candidate Ranking System.

<div align="center">

<img width="650" height="650" alt="architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09f0c36d-b93b-4bb4-8536-a9eacd13142d" />

The system combines **BM25 lexical retrieval**, **Sentence Transformer semantic similarity**, **skill matching**, **experience scoring**, and **education scoring** to generate an explainable hybrid ranking for each candidate.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rak-shi/AI-Candidate-Ranking-System.git
cd AI-Candidate-Ranking-System
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your data

Place your candidate dataset and job description inside the `data/` folder:

- `data/candidates.jsonl` — one JSON object per line, each representing a candidate profile (skills, career history, education, etc.)
- `data/job_description.docx` — the job description to rank candidates against (`.docx` or plain text supported)

### 4. Run the ranking pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

On first run, this will:
1. Load all candidates and the job description.
2. Generate and cache sentence embeddings for every candidate (`processed/embeddings.pkl`).
3. Run the hybrid ranker (BM25 + embeddings + rule-based signals).
4. Generate explanations for each ranked candidate.
5. Save the top-ranked candidates to `output.csv`.

Subsequent runs reuse the cached embeddings, so re-ranking against a new job description is fast — just delete `processed/embeddings.pkl` if your candidate data changes and needs re-embedding.

### 5. Inspect a sample candidate (optional)

```bash
python check_dataset.py
```

# 📦 Output

The system generates an **`output.csv`** file containing the final ranked candidates along with their scores and explainable ranking details.

## Sample Output
